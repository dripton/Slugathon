Slugathon is a free (licensed under the GPLv2) clone of the classic Avalon
Hill boardgame Titan. The focus is on playing against other humans across the
Internet.

It's still in heavy development and not enduser-friendly yet.  It may crash.
There's no AI yet, so you have to play all the players, or else find a friend
of two to help.

If you want to try it anyway:

1. Install all the dependencies listed at 
http://wiki.github.com/dripton/Slugathon/dependencies.  

2. Add some users and passwords to config/passwd.txt

3. In one terminal, cd to slugathon and run "python Server.py" 

4. In a second terminal (on the same or a different computer), cd to slugathon
and run "python Connect.py"

5. In a third terminal, (on the same or a different computer), cd to slugathon
and run "python Connect.py", picking a different player.  You can add up to a 
total of 6 players.

6. Chat with each other in the Anteroom window.

7. Have the first player form a game, then have the other player(s) join it,
then have the first player start it, then play some Titan.

8. If you actually did this successfully, please let me know.
