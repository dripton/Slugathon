Make sure we have the distinction between username and playername correct.  
   username also includes spectators, while playername is just for players.

Handle failed logins cleanly -- show error message in Connect

Do not allow multiple concurrent logins for same user.

Label chat widgets to match others in Anteroom

Persist usernames and server names/ports that have been used in Connect

Add chi-square test to test_dice

Convert all images from GIF to PNG.
Use OptiPNG to optimize PNG images.
Make hex overlay image names saner.

Solve the shebang line problem.  (distutils?)

Custom Exception classes subclassing pb.Error 

Standalone battle simulator

When a user drops from the server, drop his player from games.

Try PyNSource http://www.atug.com/andypatterns/pynsource.htm

Make the case and extensions of documention filenames consistent.

If a player kills a WaitingForPlayers dialog, drop him from that
game?

###############

get_usernames / got_usernames / get_games / got_games calls should 
be moved outside Anteroom into Client, which Anteroom observes.

Game should observe Client.

The main client-side list of Games should be held inside Client not
Anteroom.  Anteroom should only hold the GUI view.

We never use the observed argument on update, instead pulling the
player or game out of the action.  Drop it?

How to send to only some observers?  (e.g. a chat message for one 
player, or hidden stack contents?)  Need each observer to leave
a unique name when in attaches, and then filter based on that
name.  (Also need to be able to send to all, and to all players
involved with a certain game?)

Document all observer / observed relationships.

Need an EventSaver class that observes the stream of events hitting
a Client or Server and saves them in one or more queues.  It should
also be able to save and load.
