Make some variable names consistent:
   marker for a Marker, markername for a string
   hex1 for a MasterHex, guihex for a GUIMasterHex, hexlabel for a string
   legion for a Legion, markerid for a string
   creature for a Creature, creaturename for a string

Make sure we have the distinction between username and playername correct.  
   username also includes spectators, while playername is just for players.

Handle failed logins cleanly -- show error message in Connect

Do not allow multiple concurrent logins for same user.

Label chat widgets to match others in Anteroom

Persist usernames and server names/ports that have been used in Connect

Add chi-square test to test_dice

Solve the shebang line problem.  (distutils?)

Custom Exception classes subclassing pb.Error 

Standalone battle simulator

When a user drops from the server, drop his player from games.

Try PyNSource http://www.atug.com/andypatterns/pynsource.htm

If a player kills a WaitingForPlayers dialog, drop him from that
game?

Support sending chat messages to one user, or a group excluding some
users.

Use Observers to return results from modeless dialogs?

###############

Should WaitingForPlayers and Anteroom hold direct Game references?
For now, why not?  They're all on the client side.  Both holding
a reference to and observing the same game is kind of odd, though.

How to send to only some observers?  (e.g. a chat message for one 
player, or hidden stack contents?)  Need each observer to leave
a unique name when in attaches, and then filter based on that
name.  (Also need to be able to send to all, and to all players
involved with a certain game?)

Document all observer / observed relationships.

Need an EventSaver class that observes the stream of events hitting
a Client or Server and saves them in one or more queues.  It should
also be able to save and load.  When a new client joins, the EventSaver
should send it all events needed to sync up.

In Anteroom game list, show tower assignments, resort player names,
and show colors.


Bugs:

Click in random spot in Anteroom game list, not on an actual game, 
brings up WFP, once.

Exiting Anteroom window no longer cleanly exits process.

test_server.py seems somewhat timing-sensitive.  Sometimes throws an exception
because the username is no longer in the dict?
