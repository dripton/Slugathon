Make sure we have the distinction between username and playername correct.
username also includes spectators, while playername is just for players.

Handle failed logins cleanly -- show error message in Connect

Do not allow multiple concurrent logins for same user.

Label chat widgets to match others in Anteroom

Persist usernames and server names/ports that have been used in Connect

distutils setup.py to solve the shebang line problem.

Custom Exception classes subclassing pb.Error

Standalone battle simulator

When a user drops from the server, drop his player from games.

If a player kills a WaitingForPlayers dialog, drop him from that game?

Support sending chat messages to one user, or a group excluding some users.

Add a version number somewhere.  svn revision?  date?

But epydoc won't list public instance attributes, only methods.

Looks pretty good.  Can't get pyNsourceGui.py to work due to wxPython
versioning problems.

Game.update has lots of special logic to avoid doing the same move twice.
Need to figure out a cleaner way.

We need to document all observer / observed relationships, not just direct
containment.

Options for splitting with hidden legion contents:
1. Send a split message without details to everyone, then a reveal message per
child legion to just the splitting player.
2. Send a split message without details to everyone.  Expect the splitting
player to figure out the details.  (Easy in the interactive case since he just
sent the split request; hard in the loading game case.)
3. Send a public split message to everyone but the splitter, and a private
split message to the splitter.

Need an EventSaver class that observes the stream of events hitting a Client
or Server and saves them in one or more queues.  It should also be able to
save and load.  When a new client joins, the EventSaver should send it all
events needed to sync up.  It needs to see all information, including hidden
stack contents.

In chat, need to be able to target everyone in the lobby, everyone in one
game, and any one user.

Make Anteroom always fit on screen.

Use cairo to get antialiasing.

Make all windows remember their last position, by player.

Bugs:

Click in random spot in Anteroom game list, not on an actual game, 
brings up WaitingForPlayers, once.

Exiting Anteroom window no longer cleanly exits process.  Killing GTK windows
without control-C got a lot harder.  What happened?  
Need to insert reactor.stop() in the right places, so we can call
gtk.main_loop() instead of gtk.main_iteration in an infinite loop.

test_server.py seems somewhat timing-sensitive.  Sometimes throws an exception
because the username is no longer in the dict?  Is this solvable in py.test,
or do we need to use twisted.trial?

Need to ignore config.py so it can't get checked in accidentally.  Maybe
config-sample.py that gets renamed to config.py.

Color code StatusScreen.  Show when it's this user's turn to move.

Highlight player name in status screen when it's this player's turn.

Force split legions that cannot move to recombine.

If chits overlap the hex into the black background, the background is not
   repainted when the chit moves away.  See hex 130.

Cleanup legion elimination code.

Add player elimination code.
