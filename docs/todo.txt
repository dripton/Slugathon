Make sure we have the distinction between username and playername correct.
username also includes spectators, while playername is just for players.

Do not allow multiple concurrent logins for same user.

When a user drops from the server, drop his player from games.

If a player kills a WaitingForPlayers dialog, drop him from that game?

Support sending chat messages to one user, or a group excluding some users.

Game.update has lots of special logic to avoid doing the same move twice.
Need to figure out a cleaner way.

We need to document all observer / observed relationships, not just direct
containment.

Should WaitingForPlayers and Anteroom hold direct Game references?  For now,
why not?  They're all on the client side.  Both holding a reference to and
observing the same game is kind of odd, though.

The reference from Legion back up to Player bothers me.

Does Legion need to be Observed and throw off its own Actions, rather than
making Player do it?

Options for splitting with hidden legion contents:
1. Send a split message without details to everyone, then a reveal message per
child legion to just the splitting player.
2. Send a split message without details to everyone.  Expect the splitting
player to figure out the details.  (Easy in the interactive case since he just
sent the split request; hard in the loading game case.)
3. Send a public split message to everyone but the splitter, and a private
split message to the splitter.

Need an EventSaver class that observes the stream of events hitting a Client
or Server and saves them in one or more queues.  It should also be able to
save and load.  When a new client joins, the EventSaver should send it all
events needed to sync up.  It needs to see all information, including hidden
stack contents.

In chat, need to be able to target everyone in the lobby, everyone in one
game, and any one user.

In Anteroom game list, show tower assignments, resort player names, and show
colors.  Can we get all the game status we need in there, or do we need a
separate window?  Anteroom is pretty big, so maybe a separate window is easier
to use alongside the masterboard.

Make Anteroom always fit on screen.

Use cairo to get antialiasing.

Bugs:

Click in random spot in Anteroom game list, not on an actual game, 
brings up WaitingForPlayers, once.

Exiting Anteroom window no longer cleanly exits process.  Killing GTK windows
without control-C got a lot harder.  What happened?  
Need to insert reactor.stop() in the right places, so we can call
gtk.main_loop() instead of gtk.main_iteration in an infinite loop.

test_server.py seems somewhat timing-sensitive.  Sometimes throws an exception
because the username is no longer in the dict?  Is this solvable in py.test,
or do we need to use twisted.trial?

Need to ignore config.py so it can't get checked in accidentally.  Maybe
config-sample.py that gets renamed to config.py.

If Inspector window is closed, a new one will appear but never show legions.

Mulligan should first undo all moves.

Color code StatusScreen.  Show when it's this user's turn to move.

Add else clause for unhandled actions in update methods.

Does gtk.window_set_default_icon_from_file work?

Highlight player name in status screen when it's this player's turn.

Do not highlight 7-high stacks during the muster phase.

Sort creatures in Inspector / ShowLegion

During movement, after selecting a stack, clicking on a non-highlighted
   hex should immediately re-highlight eligible stacks.

Allowed to exit move phase with split legions in case where recombine
   should be forced.
