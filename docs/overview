The central class is Server, which represents a single game server.  A
Server can be used for more than one simultaneous Game.  (This is a major 
change from Colossus.)

When a Client connects to a Server, it should get back a list of existing
Games and Users connected to the server, which Users are connected
to which Games, which Games still have openings, etc.  AnteRoom should
display this information.  Each User needs a unique player name and a
matching password.  During development these can be added by hand to a
text file; we can do something more elaborate later.

Any user can use the FormGame dialog to set up a new Game.  Attributes 
that can be attached to a game might include a unique number, a unique name, 
time formed, minimum and maximum number of players, a password to setup 
private games, a time limit for players to join before the game starts, 
settings for optional rules, whether AIs are welcome, etc.

Other clients can join games, as players or observers, by selecting them
in AnteRoom.  When a game starts (either by the maximum number of players
having joined, or at least the minimum number of players having joined plus
the time limit being hit or the forming player saying to start), only new
observers can join, not new players.  (Though we should eventually allow 
observers or AIs to take over for players who drop, and use a karma
system to penalize players who drop and reward those who take over for
dropped players.)

When a game starts, towers are rolled for, then players pick colors in
ascending order of tower number.  When all colors have been assigned, the
starting 8-high legions are placed in their towers, and the first player
is given priority to start his turn.
