Requirements for Slugathon:

Allow playing Titan against network and AI opponents
Server enforces the rules and does not trust clients
Portable to at least Linux, Windows, MacOS
Test-first development; unit tests for everything possible
Very robust code
No duplicated code
Simple, usable GUI
Allow standalone battles
Allow observers
Allow unlimited undo/redo, and saving/loading games
Master server for finding games, statistics tracking


Simplifications versus Colossus:

No variants (at first)
No threads on server side
Very few options
Python instead of Java
Twisted PB instead of raw socket protocol
Hardcoded dictionaries/lists for data, so no parsers
Use Subversion instead of CVS, to track moved files, etc.


GUI toolkit candidates:

PyGTK2: A bit hard to install.  Ugly API.
PyUI: Widgets on top of PyGame.  Pretty.  Not many widgets.  Stability?
wxPython: Multiple event loops won't unify with Twisted.
TkInter: Included with Python.  Ugly.  Slow.
PyGame: No higher-level GUI widgets, just surfaces.
PyQt: Not (yet) portable to Mac, bad license on Windows.
