GUI toolkit candidates:

PyGTK2: Glade support.  A bit hard to install.  Ugly API.
PyUI: Widgets on top of PyGame.  Pretty.  Not many widgets.  Stability?
wxPython: Multiple event loops won't unify with Twisted.
TkInter: Included with Python.  Ugly.  Slow.
PyGame: No higher-level GUI widgets, just surfaces.
PyQt: Not (yet) portable to Mac, bad license on Windows.
