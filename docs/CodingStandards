Clarifications:
No tabs in code, period.  Spaces only.
No code past column 79.
Continuation lines should be indented two spaces past the continued line.

Don't use "from package import *"

Use only Python code unless C is absolutely necessary.  If you must write
something in C (e.g. the innermost most speed-critical AI loops), write a
Python prototype first.  Do not use C++, ever.

Write unit tests for everything that could possibly break.

Avoid unnecessary class coupling:
Follow the Law of Demeter.  Classes should only talk to immediately contained
   classes, classes passed in as parameters, and to classes they create.
Contained classes should not hold references to their containers.

Initialize instances as thoroughly as possible in __init__, rather than 
   tweaking them after creation.
