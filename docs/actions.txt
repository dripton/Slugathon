Game Actions

Goals:
  Minimize coupling
  Keep the code simple
  Avoid duplicate code
  Prevent cheating
  Support convenient unit testing
  Allow standalone battles
  Allow replaying or stepping through savegames, and use the same mechanism
    to support undo / redo / stepping through the current game
  Minimize network traffic
  Maximize performance, especially of the AI
  Spread the CPU and memory load among server and clients

(Obviously there are tradeoffs.)


Security:

1. Preventing illegal actions:
  Simple object models that let the client directly manipulate the state of
    the server will result in cheating.  There needs to be a layer of
    permission checking.  PB's perspectives keep users from spoofing one
    another.  Each action must be manually checked to see if that user is
    currently allowed to perform that action.  We need a common idiom for
    this to make these checks hard to forget and easy to code.  Using a
    single point for external actions (e.g. Game.apply(action, player, args)
    should help.
  
2. Avoiding information leakage:
  The server must avoid sharing hidden information (other players' legion
    contents, the state of the random number generator) with clients.
  Revealing the contents of a legion is a separate action, with a restricted
    list of observers.  Chatting is similar, but not really part of the
    game protocol.  Other game actions are all public.
    
We should avoid leading clients around by the nose with prompting actions 
  like "Flee?"  They should be smart enough (using the shared Game
  logic) to see that there's an engagement and their legion is the target 
  so they need to send a Flee / Concede / Fight / Wait.

Client-to-server calls will go to Server (for the few whole-server actions
  like logging in) or to User (for the many per-user actions).  From there
  they should be routed to Game.

Server-to-client calls will go to (one or more instances of) Client.  We
  will not allow direct client-to-client calls.  This means that the client
  will not need to permission-check external calls.  From Client they should
  be routed to Game.  (Possibly also a LogWindow.)

We'd like to reuse the same basic logic classes (Game, Player, Legion,
  Creature, Movement, etc.) on the client and server sides.  This means
  extracting the ability to directly modify real game state from them.
  It also means the Legion class must be usable without certain knowledge
  of its contents.
The standard Observer pattern is a solution.  We use attach / detach /
  notify.  If the list of observers is empty, then no actions are broadcast 
  from this instance.  To avoid coupling, container classes get direct 
  references to contained classes, but the contained classes only see 
  their containers as Observers.
Actions should cascade back up the observation hierarchy (e.g. Creature to 
  Legion to Game to Client to User) in a way that makes it easy to detach
  observers for hypothetical situations (AI, stepping through history).
  
The related jobs of creating savegames and logging game actions should be
  merged.  (Though additional debug logging will be needed.)  The Saver is
  an observer on the Game.


Every operation that can affect real game state is an action.
Savegames are just action logs.
If we load a savegame, or a new spectator joins in mid-game, sync game
  state by replaying the action stream.  Need a "new game" action to signal 
  a client that may have already been observing to clear its state and 
  start receiving the action stream from the beginning.  (We might optimize
  this later to take advantage of a spectator's existing knowledge.)

When a player attempts to change game state from the GUI (example: moving 
  a legion to a new hex), the action trickles up to the client's Game 
  (where it will be error-checked and an exception raised if illegal), 
  then from Client up to User on the server side.

Safe GUI actions that do not attempt to change game state (e.g. viewing a 
  legion's contents) should require no communication with the server.  This 
  should extend to more complex actions like rewinding through game history.

Should we extend this to letting a player make multiple "unsafe" actions 
  locally then attempt to commit the action stream to the server?
  (Analagous to line-buffering in a chat client -- other users don't see
  how slowly the user types or how often he backspaces, just the line.)
  No -- it's good to show the action stream as close to realtime as 
  possible, to keep other users interested and keep everyone playing fast,
  even though this exposes a bunch of undo actions.  AIs should be an 
  exception since watching an AI constantly undo moves would be annoying.
  (Except perhaps in a debug mode?)

Undone actions should be trimmed from savegames for neatness.  But we 
  can't prune undone actions from the client's action record too
  early, or we break the ability to redo them.  Just keep a separate
  local redo stack on the client only.

When a player tries to make an illegal move, the exception should only
  be shown to his client.  So attempts to make illegal moves should not 
  reset inactivity timeouts.

We should be able to handle standalone battles by creating mock versions of
  non-battle classes.  Treat Legion and Forces separately.

We need a non-GUI console client, for debugging and automated testing and
  AI use.  This implies the ability to stringify and unstringify actions.
